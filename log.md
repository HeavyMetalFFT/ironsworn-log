Dagobert skips town thanks to a tip from his barkeep buddy, and meets Gunther at Red Falls.  Gunther tells him of finding the dead druid, and asks (since he's not doing anything, and is an experienced hunter) if he wants to help him seek out the Ash Bear.  Just then, the militia is spotted coming up the river.  The two leave promptly, unable to gather ample supplies for their journey, and give the militia the slip in the wilds.

They journey west across the plains of the Havens and into the eastern Deep Wilds, encountering few challenges.  They find the bald-topped mountains known as the Three Sisters that rise from the forest, their sides cloaked in dense green.  

Scouting reveals that there are Ash Bears everywhere, and that they have physical enhancements such as increased speed and strength, as well as glowing red eyes.  In addition, they always patrol in pairs.  It becomes evident that they are guarding the Three Sisters, and that there is a central alarm system that can summon the bears if something (such as a stray Wyvern) is detected on any of the mountains.

After some days of scouting and observation, the pair sneak successfully into the patrolled territory, aided by magical fox pelts with mask their appearance and scent.  They discover a blast door, complete with keypad and retina scanner, leading into the side of a rock face.  A bear can occasionally be seen entering and exiting using the retina scanner.

The pair wait until a bear enters the door, and then use Dagobert's hawk "Falco" (plus a polecat pelt) to set off the alarm.  They successfully slip into the door as the Ash Bear comes running out, unnoticed despite only having a single working fox pelt between them.

Inside they find a hallway of dark, polished granite, its walls set with glowing sconses.  A utility drone skitters up the hall on some task, but pays them no mind.
