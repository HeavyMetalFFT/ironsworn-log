## Ironlands
The Ironlands were formed when a terraformed interstellar vessel was forced to land on our planet.  It crashed into an icy northern island group, destroying many of the central islands.  The islands to the southeast became the barrier islands, while some larger masses to the north were also spared destruction.  These northern islands are often connected to the Ironlands by sea ice.  High-quality meteor metals, many of them ferrous, stud the land, their craters often weathered and overgrown.

## Old Ones
The original crew of the vessel went mad during their space journey, as did the central control AI that administers the ship/continent.  These are what we call The Broken.

The giants of the north are natives of the northern islands, and have since begun exploring south as far as the Tempest Hills.

The elves lost 90% of their population due to the aftereffects of the crash, as well as vast amounts of their significant cultural centers.  The survivors were isolated clans from the west of their empire, who have since begun to spread to the new land.  They wear their masks as a ward against the Hunters, tracking beasts employed by the central AI to further its mad ambitions.  The Hunters appear to rely heavily on facial recognition.

I can't remember whether we defined an origin or role for the Varou.

## Eldritch Forces
The arrival of this new continent has awakened ancient slumbering demon lords from the deeps seas and the icy north.  Additionally, the central AI apparently went mad during the space journey.  What sort of force caused this?  

## A Great Plague and Violent Floods
...accompanied the arrival of the new land.  People all over the more populous and hospitable realms were driven to despair by the disease, famine, war, and lawless chaos that followed.  Our coastal peoples put their trust in their shipbuilding and sailing, and struck out toward the eerie light of the northern seas.

# Summary

## Session 0

Dagobert skips town thanks to a tip from his barkeep buddy, and meets Gunther at Red Falls.  Gunther tells him of finding the dead druid, and asks (since he's not doing anything, and is an experienced hunter) if he wants to help him seek out the Ash Bear.  Just then, the militia is spotted coming up the river.  The two leave promptly, unable to gather ample supplies for their journey, and give the militia the slip in the wilds.

They journey west across the plains of the Havens and into the eastern Deep Wilds, encountering few challenges.  They find the bald-topped mountains known as the Three Sisters that rise from the forest, their sides cloaked in dense green.  

Scouting reveals that there are Ash Bears everywhere, and that they have physical enhancements such as increased speed and strength, as well as glowing red eyes.  In addition, they always patrol in pairs.  It becomes evident that they are guarding the Three Sisters, and that there is a central alarm system that can summon the bears if something (such as a stray Wyvern) is detected on any of the mountains.

After some days of scouting and observation, the pair sneak successfully into the patrolled territory, aided by magical fox pelts with mask their appearance and scent.  They discover a blast door, complete with keypad and retina scanner, leading into the side of a rock face.  A bear can occasionally be seen entering and exiting using the retina scanner.

The pair wait until a bear enters the door, and then use Dagobert's hawk "Falco" (plus a polecat pelt) to set off the alarm.  They successfully slip into the door as the Ash Bear comes running out, unnoticed despite only having a single working fox pelt between them.

Inside they find a hallway of dark, polished granite, its walls set with glowing sconses.  A utility drone skitters up the hall on some task, but pays them no mind.


# Locations

## Warm Spring
Built over top of an alien reactor that vents heat into the waters around it.  The top of the ancient reactor forms a plateau outside of town.  Mysterious alien runes mark the outside bringing bold red and yellow coloring the the weathered matte grey monolith.

## Red Falls Outpost
A trading outpost.  Set next to a waterfall that often catches the sunset in a blaze of glory.  Downstream lies Warm Spring, 4 hours.  Upstream and beyond is wilderness.

## Three Sisters radio sensor installation
The Three Sisters house what was at one point a deep-space EM sensor array, as well as the associated local control, maintainence, and power installation.  The central AI has decided to repurpose the array into an active directed energy array for use in its onging campaign against the Demon Lords.  To this end, it is buffing up the power station and supply lines, replacing the delicate receive sensors with high-power capable transmitters, and tweaking control systems as needed.
