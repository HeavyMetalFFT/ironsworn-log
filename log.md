# Summary

## Session 0

Dagobert skips town thanks to a tip from his barkeep buddy, and meets Gunther at Red Falls.  Gunther tells him of finding the dead druid, and asks (since he's not doing anything, and is an experienced hunter) if he wants to help him seek out the Ash Bear.  Just then, the militia is spotted coming up the river.  The two leave promptly, unable to gather ample supplies for their journey, and give the militia the slip in the wilds.

They journey west across the plains of the Havens and into the eastern Deep Wilds, encountering few challenges.  They find the bald-topped mountains known as the Three Sisters that rise from the forest, their sides cloaked in dense green.  

Scouting reveals that there are Ash Bears everywhere, and that they have physical enhancements such as increased speed and strength, as well as glowing red eyes.  In addition, they always patrol in pairs.  It becomes evident that they are guarding the Three Sisters, and that there is a central alarm system that can summon the bears if something (such as a stray Wyvern) is detected on any of the mountains.

After some days of scouting and observation, the pair sneak successfully into the patrolled territory, aided by magical fox pelts which mask their appearance and scent.  They discover a blast door, complete with keypad and retina scanner, leading into the side of a rock face.  A bear can occasionally be seen entering and exiting using the retina scanner.

The pair waits until a bear enters the door, and then use Dagobert's hawk "Falco" (plus a polecat pelt) to set off the alarm.  They successfully slip into the door as the Ash Bear comes running out, unnoticed despite only having a single working fox pelt between them.

Inside they find a hallway of dark, polished granite, its walls set with glowing sconses.  A utility drone skitters up the hall on some task, but pays them no mind.

## Session 1

They investigate the Three Sisters installation.  Using stealth, they avoid a passing patrol spider, but generally find the installation eerily abandoned except for the single-minded, ant-like maintenance drones.  Gunther finds a large locked door, and notices that a maintenance drone uses a pheremone to open it.  He kills an ant and pushes it against the detector, which succeeds in opening the door.

Inside they find three tiny closets with automatic doors.  Stepping into one reveals it to be a fully automated lift, which the pair mistake for a magical teleportation chamber.  

The lift deposits them in a fully subterranean chamber excavated from the top of the central mountain.  Exploration reveals mysterious chambers full of inscrutible devices, but the pair are drawn to a room with a throne atop a dais.  Dagobert, ever power-hungry, sits in the throne and dons the "crown", a helmet connected to the wall by a flexible wiring conduit.  He finds that he is able to observe the area around the installation as if flying, though with limited detail; furthermore, he is able to zoom in on each patrol bear.  Gunther is intrigued by the ability to mind-meld with bears, and after using the throne, finds that he is able to experience the sensory products of each patrol bear - and even synthesize those of multiple bears - all intuitively.  

Realizing that the throne must be the key to the bears, they explore further and discover a rear chamber behind the throne.  The chamber is filled with cylindrical vats of thick crystal, capped on each end with bright metal and containing pulsing, brain-like organs set in a viscous, transparent golden ichor.  The throne assembly itself is connected to the vats via devices which hum softly and are covered in faint, glowing lights.

The pair smashes all the brain vats except for two, which they disconnect and bundle up to take with them.  Returning to the throne room, they find that all but two of the bears have fled into the wilds.  Two bears remain in an unresponsive state.  

The two stealthily retrace their steps to the exit and seek out the nearest bear.  As they draw near with the two brain vats, the bear jerkily animates and attacks, although suffering from severe glitching and general impairment.  After a battle in which both Ironsworn suffer grave maulings but no broken bones, the bear is brought down and its carcass harvested.  

That night, a severe storm prevents Gunther from enchanting the carcass.  The two argue over what to do next, and come near to falling out.  Dagobert stubbornly wishes to return to Warm Springs and murder Niles; meanwhile Gunther wants no part in this vendetta.  Eventually Dagobert agrees that a second bear pelt would provide a potential material advantage, and the two begin a hunt for the second bear.

This task proves challenging, however, as during the night the bear has regained some consciousness and control.  The two are forced to track the bear, and encounter a band of ten elves who launch arrows on sight.  The pair flees, with Dagobert disappearing under a giant fallen tree, while Gunther outdistances the elves after several minutes' chase.  After carefully regrouping, the pair continue and make camp in a clearing deep the forest, where Gunther is able to enchant the bear pelt.  The following day they find a deep cavern into which the second bear has withdrawn.

They ambush the bear in the cavern, and another hard-fought battle ensues, in which Gunther is severely wounded.  That night evidence of a serious infection begins to emerge, and the two spend the night damaged, ill-supplied, and beset by prowling carrion creatures.  A chill wind laden with the stench of filth blows through the cavern, and an aura of doom hangs about the place.

## Session 2

The pair leaves the cave and begin a journey back toward the Three Sisters, intending to retrace ther steps.  Gunther grows frustrated with Dagobert's fixation on killing Niles, and draws from him Dagobert's account of his history with Niles.

During the journey, a conspiracy of ravens begins following them.  

That evening, Gunther's infection grows markedly worse.  Dagobert goes hunting in the long northern summer twilight, while Gunther - beginning to lose touch with reality - attempts a moon ritual to enchant the new bear pelt.  The ritual succeeds, but when Dagobert returns he find Gunther curled up and raving about the eyes in the trees.  He is *Shaken*.

Dagobert decides that they need to leave the Deep Wilds ASAP, and sends Falco to scout the area.  They find their way to a blighted, withered plain covered in the skeletons of dead trees.

After several hard days of travel, with Gunther doing little better and the ravens still following, they arrive at a fort (wooden, motte and palisade).  This is the first Broken settlement ever recorded by men - previous contact has been more fleeting.  The manage to communicate with the Broken via miming and drawings in the dirt, and make a favorable impression with the gift of one of the brain vats from the Three Sisters installation, as well as Gunther's now-unused pipe.

The Broken help bring Gunther back from the edge of oblivion with balms and a shamanic tent full of Viking Space Mushroom vapors; however, there is little time for full healing. The Broken are also freaked out by the ravens because they know it means a Varou warband is close behind.  They show enlist the aid of the two Ironsworn in setting an ambush in a ravine, with the Ironsworn as bait.  They take them out in the dark of night, but due to the short nights, a raven is still able to spot them.  Dagobert's Falco kills it, but it may not have been enough...

The pair camps, lying in wait for the Varou, with Falco spotting.  The Varou, thanks to their Raven, manage avoid Falco's eyes and come upon them suddenly, forcing them to abandon their camp gear.  The Varou chase them away from the ravine and fort, but in a valiant maneuver the pair gallop their horses hard and turn the chase back on track, cutting so close that Dagobert delivers a crushing blow, killing the shaman.

They reach the ravine.  Gunther braces himself ready to defend and retreat.  Dagobert leaps from his horse and discovers a precariously balanced, large boulder.  He rolls this boulder into four attackers who are heading straight for Gunther, killing three.  Gunther is able to retreat down the ravine and climb up a wall.  The Varou are hopelessly ambushed, and are driven before the Broken.  

A single Varou Berserker who dodged the boulder follows Gunther down the ravine, slaying Broken who attack him from above.  Gunther and Dagobert have just finished off their foes up top when the berserker appears and attacks Gunther.  Dagobert throws a dagger, which knocks the berserker's falchion from his hand moments before it would have hit Gunther.  Gunther instead receives a wicked four-claw scar on his face.  Gunther defends against the berserker's onslaught, but is forced back; the Varou draws a wicked curved dagger.  Dagobert throws a knife, which buries in the berserker's back, but he shrugs it off.  Falco dives from above, distracting the berserker.  Gunther takes advantage and decapitates the Varou with a mighty blow.

The two Ironsworn *Forge a Bond* with an epic handshake.

They recover their camp gear and head back for a party at the fort.  They stay with the Broken for some time, recovering from their wounds and *Forging a Bond* with the community, learning some snippets of the Broken tongue, and teaching the language of their land a well.  They discover that the two people have some mysterious factors in common.  They seem to have some myths and tales with remarkably similar themes and endings.  In addition, the word for the dark night sky above in the Broken tongue is "Abyss".  

During this time they also learn of a new quest.  The Broken give them an old map with a location in the Tempest Hills where they say this clan used to live.  Their city lay beneath a huge (bioengineered) pine tree on an island constructed in the middle of a crater lake.  The lake lies in the middle of a dense pine wood, high atop a craggy hill.  Their grandparents were forced to flee the city by a beast that was killing people in the darkness one by one.  There is a blade which no Broken may wield, but which is said to be able to kill the beast.  

The blade is a sentient vibroblade that is able to channel some of the psionic magic of the mad AI.  Any Broken who handles it can be mind-controlled, but normal humans get at worst a weird spooky feeling.

The two Ironsworn *Swear and Iron Vow* to find the city, retrieve the blade, and slay the fell Beast, bringing back a token of its death so that the Broken clan might return to the land of their forefathers.

## Session 4

Vow to the giants is fulfilled - Dagobert dumps out a sack full of heads.  Gunther presents the stolen ivory.  The giants call for a toast of fermented Mammoth's milk, and elect two giants to act as guides to the Ironsworn.  A *Bond is Forged*.  The Ironsworn show the giants that Gunther can enchant a mammoth skin, and the giants want one too.  But that night while binding the first skin, Gunther is beset by the wild spirits of the hills, and feels the eyes of the mammoths on him, and is so drained he collapses.

The next day they recuperate with the giants, who are excited for that night's spectacle.  When the moon is full, Gunther calls upon the second mammoth's spirit, but the mammoth, angered at the murder of its fellow, refuses to be bound back to this plane, and grows hostile, causing a wild wind and bellowing voices.  All the mammoths grow wild.  The giants grow afraid and angry, and banish the Ironsworn from their camp, *Breaking their Bond* and refusing to honor their end of the deal.

Gunther is barely clinging to consciousness, and the angry mammoth spiritnow begins shadowing him.  Dagobert throws him over a horse, and gets the two of them to a sheltered area where he makes camp.  Eventually Gunther comes around.

Despite Gunther's weariness, he insists they press on, and they journey further into the hills.  There they once again encounter the strange voices, which Gunther is better able to percieve this time.  He realizes that they are some manifestation of the ancient elven gods who have recognized in the Ironsworn a potential set of tools to counter the forces that threaten their children.  

The touch of the elven gods grants Gunther a mild trance-like state, and he effortlessly guides the pair to a dense grove, in which there lies a clearing set with standing stones.  There sits a masked elf who speaks to them in elven to which Gunther, still enchanted, responds in perfect classical elven.  The elf tells them that the elven gods favor them, and that the way to the forest will be clear.  Upon reaching the forest they must seek out the Elder Druid, Old Man Oak, who guards the Staff of Heimdall.  He points the way, and sees them on their journey.

They finally reach a circle of hills, in the middle of which is a vast, bowl-like valley, with a smaller hill in its center.  The valley and hill are covered in a dark, dense forest.  Barely visible from their vantage on the outer rim is the giant tree in the center of the forest.

Journeying into the forest, they find it silent and foreboding, every sound dying mutely.  Suddenly, a large, tuft-eared squirrel appears, and hurriedly guides them to his master, the Elder Druid, who is a massive animated oak tree.  The Druid ponders the Ironsworn, and reveals (to Gunther, in elven) that the forest has been befouled by three witches: the Witch of Light, the Witch of the Void, and the Witch of Eternity.  They live a cottage that is larger on the inside than on the outside.

(The witches are Broken who became followers of The Beyond). 

The Druid gives the Ironsworn an iron mirror which is coated in magical quicksilver.  The mirror will reveal the true form of anything reflected in it.  He warns them not to let the witches work together - that each can be defeated only on her own, and that the three together are very powerful.  The pair *Swears an Iron Vow* to rid the forest of the three evil witches.  

They set off following a dark, bubbling, viscous river.  Suddenly a gondola appears, in which sits the Witch of Eternity, shaded (even in darkness) by a parasol, and gazing into an orb filled with stars, nebulae, and black holes.  The gondola is poled by shambling forms who rise as if being born from the murk, and then decay as they walk the length of the gondola, crumpling into a rotting heap as they fall off the back.  The Witch calls in a twisting, impossible voice that she has foreseen the deaths of the Ironsworn, and that the Beyond beckons to them.  She then unleases a burst of Beyond-light from her orb which seems to slow time for the Ironsworn, while a crowd of her minions emerge from the river, advancing deliberately.

As the gondola submerges (replete with echoing cackles), Gunther calmly draws his axe and, with a flurry of blows, destroys two zombies and crumpling another's face with his shield.  He then delivers a mighty kick which caves its ribs and sends it toppling backwards into the murk.  Dagobert, meanwhile, feints and trips a charging corpse, then smashes its skull with his club.  Gunther then pulverizes the final zombie, and they move off, idly kicking twitching bits back into the river of death.

The journey along the river seems eternal.  Ghastly visions of pale corpses with luminous staring eyes beset the pair, and they arrive at a dark pond feeling on-edge.  Just beyond the water lies a tiny cottage.

## Session 5

Gunther and Dagobert make to circle the cottage, but they set off a ward, and the lagoon begins to swirl and rise while the cottage sinks into the murk.  They make a sprint for the door and manage to duck inside as the cottage disappears into a silent, inky blackness.  Gradually, strange stars appear in the black outside.  

The cottage has a cozy central room, and on each wall is a door.  The door to their left is ajar, and beyond it appears to be a giant cathedral, more massive than anything that could realistically constructed.  The other two doors are locked.  Gunther find a witch's hairpin among the knick knacks in the room, and Dagobert uses it to pick the locks on the other two doors.  The central door contains a long pier which recedes beyond vision, surrounded on all sides by still, black water.  As Dagobert works on the right-hand door, deep chanting of many voices echoes from the cathedral.  It comes nearer to the door, and just as long shadows fall on the stones near the cathedral door, he opens the lock on the final door.  The pair dash inside and shut it.

They find themselves in a freezing crystal labyrinth.  As the begin to explore, they hear voices, and take cover in an alcove.  They observe the Witch of Light and her assistant - a floating sphere of light - investigating the door alarm.  The Witch suspects that goblin emissaries, whom they expected to arrive later, may have snuck in early.  The sphere promises to investigate while the witch rushes back to finish the casting of a crystal golem.  She posts two golem guards at the door.

The Ironsworn follow the sphere to a room where the Pendant of Protection sits atop a pedastal, surrounded by a web of blinding lights rays.  Gunther uses the Magic Mirror to avert certain rays as Dagobert picks his way through, retrieving the pendant.  

The pair explores the labyrinth, finding that the pendant disarms all manner of traps and illusions as they progress.  They then rescue a pair of dryads who have been captured in the woods and are in the process of being corrupted and turned into future dungeon monsters.  A great lense has been used to focus astral radiation on them, and they backs and shoulders have sprouted whip-like woody tendrils.  The group also find a sleeping white cat who wears a diamond collar.

Finally, the group finds the witch carefully ladling a scalding, viscous substance from a crystal vat into a golem mould.  Dagobert attempts to sneak behind her, but the pendant which he is wearing disrupts the ritual magic, alerting the witch, who conjures a great sphere of ice around Dagobert.  The pendant resists the spell just long enough for him to leap out of the way.  The witch then lets loose blasts of light and glittering ice, which Dagobert dodges, assisted by the pendant.  Meanwhile, Gunther rushes to the half-formed but sentient golem, overturning the massive mould and smashing the contents on the ground, rendering the golem useless.  The dryads charge the witch, who is focused on Dagobert and Gunther.  They throw her screaming into her vat, where she dies.  The whole dimension begins to crack, and gouts of steam burst from fissues.  The cat wakes and flees; Gunther sees this, and directs the party to follow the fleeing cat.  They reach the door as the magic of the labyrinth fails completely, and pile into the cozy central room followed by blasts of steam.  They shut the door, which becomes encased in a thick layer of ice.

The dryads stand guard in the cozy room while the Ironsworn investigate the Pier into the Abyss.  Following the pier for a great length of time, it abruptly ends, with a row-boat moored there.  Despite the horror of the place, the heros steel themselves and row into the darkness.  The pier quickly recedes and they row for some time in eerie stillness.  They row for some time before finally spotting a dark mass - and island, perhaps - on the grey horizon.  Suddenly the waters about them begin to move, first slowly and then more rapidly, forming a great whirlpool.  Using his Skin of Mammoth Strength, Gunther hauls upon the oars, while Dagobert steers with a steering oar, moving the boat directly away from the sucking center.  They continue on towards the island.

Suddenly beneath them the water churns, and a great tentacle shoots forth.  The Ironsworn, prepared for such an occurence, attack it with vigor, Gunther with his axe and Dagobert with a Broken spear.  The tentacle is rendered useless, and they hear great bellow from beneath the inky waters.  Rowing with all his strength, Gunther moves the boat away, but looking back they see a huge head with a single great eye appear from the waves, while more tentacles churn the waters around it.

They row uneasily toward the island, but as they reach the shallows, they feel the waters churn again as the huge form of the beast moves beneath their boat and pushes upward, grasping the gunwhales and beginning to crack the hull.  Gunther swiftly hacks one tentacle off, and Dagobert slits another clean through with his favorite long knife.  Gunther then casts his own spear into the eyes of the beast, which roars and thrashes in the shallows.  Seeing his moment, he takes Dagobert's spear and leaps toward the floundering beast, stabbing it through the heart.  Disappearing beneath the water, he re-emerges covered in ink with the great pulsing heart of the beast, which they dub a Kraken, not knowing a better term.

Limping the boar to shore, they find the island has a steep rocky knoll in the center.  Circling this, they discover a low-slung stone hut from which muttering and complaining can be heard.  Peering in, they see an imp, a loupe to his eye, examining a large stone and making tiny marks with jeweler's tools.  Approaching quietly, they seize the imp, and eventually learn that he is a slave of the Witch of the Void.  The devise a plan, and make their way to the paved stone summoning circle at its top.  The imp delivers to the witch the final stone for her summoning ritual.  The witch then summons an eldritch horror from the Void into her retaining field.  As she does, Gunther approaches with the Pendant of Protection, its ability to disrupt magic clearly destabilizing the field near the weakened gem.  As the witch begins to cast a spell, Dagobert appears from the shadows behind her, and points out that the witch will be a very good distraction for the horror while the rest of them escape.  The witch agrees to release the imp from her service and go with it to Hell, where the imp vows she will be imprisoned for eternity.  The imp, in payment, takes the last alien brain vat and the heart of the Kraken.  At the last moment, as he teleports away, he grabs the weakened gem.  

The Ironsworn flee as behind them the horror begins consuming the fabric of the dimension around them.  Mad whispers of pure destruction attempt to twist the sanity of the heros, but they remain strong and make for the shore.  There they find that the earth has opened and great cracks have swallowed much of the water, while the rest is flying about in waterspouts.  Twisted monsters of the depths flop and flail on the sea bed.  The pair run into this chaos as reality continues to be consumed around them.  Suddenly they see the far side of the dimension approaching rapidly as space is yanked inward.  Leaping up the rent and distorted terrain, they see the shattered remnants of the pier approaching, the door still intact at its end.  They throw themselves bodlily through the door, and as they emerge into the cozy room, the door behind them vanishes, turning into a window.  In the windows hangs a small red charm in the shape of an imp, which Dagobert pockets.

## Session 6

They enter the massive cathedral.  Pillars reach into ceilings lost in the shadows above.  Azure, red, and golden light falls from huge stained glass pieces that depict the witch, the Beyond, bloody rituals, and various avatars of Time and Eternity.  Gargoyles silently alert the witch, who sends acolytes whom she has preserved through time at the expense of their higher order mental function.  Darting among the collosal pillars, the Ironsworn ambush the acolytes and destroy them.  They take their robes and also find a strange fractal key.  They spend long hours searching through the massive room, finally coming to a place where three passages, still massive in scale, form a cross.  Taking the left-hand route they come upon a huge figure - a massive avatar of the Beyond - blocking the passage before them.  The pair is immediately suspicious as the creature begins moving toward them, and Dagobert pulls out the iron mirror from Old Man Oak, which reveals the illusory nature of the horror.  They stroll right through the beast, and continue onwards down the passage.  Traveling for quite some time, the encounter a crossroads... and realize they are coming out of the right-hand passage where they were before.

Traveling down the central passage, the climb a huge set of stairs and hear chanting, the sound of a pipe organ, and a loud voice calling out.  Approaching cautiously, they see rows of pews filled with whispy, shadowy figures who kneel and stand, gnashing their teeth, muttering, moaning, and occasionally calling out in an incomprehensible tongue.  In a pulpit at the front stands a figure in black bishop's robes trimmed with silver and wearing a silver mitre.  The figure has a gaunt, skeletal face and is intoning prayers solemnly in a language just beyond comprehension while huge black candles burn around him, giving off a pale light.  Gunther, enchanted, moves toward a great altar at the front of the room.  Dagobert, seeing this, follows and slaps him about the face, breaking the trance.  The bishops figure smiles at them, and the face becomes that of the Witch of Eternity.  The shadowy area behind the pulpit seems to grow in size and the witch disappears backwards at a great rate, cackling.  The candles puff out, and the shadowy figures seem to disappear.  The two hurry forward, but find themselves in a realm of complete blackness.  Each step brings the sensation of moving a vast distance very rapidly.  After several such steps, a grey light appears, and a final step brings them out into a new place.

They find themselves in a ruined city, cobblestones slick with moss, and building crawling with vines and set with stunted trees.  A grey sky hangs overhead, and nothing stirs, not even the wind.  They appear to be next to the ruins of a cathedral, but one of ordinary size.  Behind it they find a cemetary where a mausoleum still stands.  Inside are three mozaics, one on each wall.  The first mosaic depicts the death of the Witch of Light at the hands of the two Ironsworn and the two dryads.  The second depicts the red imp binding the witch inside a circle while the two Ironsworn and a massive tentacle-faced beast look on.  The final mural depicts the Ironsworn saving a little girl in a white dress from a crowd of hooded cultists.  In the mausoleum as well is a great set of double wooden doors heading heading downwards into the earth.  The rusty lock falls off easily and the doors smash downward.  

Below the mausoleum is a set of stairs leading into a dank catacomb.  The long passage is filled with dark water, and a familiar looking gondola sits moored there.  The two ironsworn pole their way down the cataomb, and quickly encounter shambling catacomb corpses, which come from all sides.  Gunther fends them off with his pole for some time while Dagobert builds their speed.  Suddenly, they come upon a huge mass of corpses barricading the way forward.  They plow the gondola into it, and Dagobert attempts to jump free, but is grabbed by a corpse and pulled into the water.  Gunther clears away many with his pole and manages to help free Dagobert, but is forced to drop the pole and pull out his axe and shield.  Dagobert stumbles to the shallows at the side of the passage.  Gunther cleaves several more times, while Dagobert grabs the pole, which he breaks across a group of corpses, leaving him with a sharper, shorter pole, which he stabs into the chest of another corpse.  With a roar, Gunther clears a gap in the corpses which block the gondola, and calls to Dagobert, who sprints, yanking the pole from the chest of its latest victim, and vaulting out onto the gondola, which is carried forward.  They pole away, but no sooner have the escaped the corpses than the water beneath them inexplicably begins to move, and they are carried swiftly to a pool where a vast whirlpool draws them towards a strange glowing light.

They emerge in a city - the same city, but living and beautiful.  Couples stroll the banks of the canal, and children sing ring aroud the rosie.  The sky above is a deep azure, and stars are visible, as well as a glowing red nebula; but a small, golden sun still shines, creating a surreal daylight.  They are in a gondola being poled along by a stately gondolier, who informs them (in ancient Broken - which the two understand without realizing it at the time) that they are almost at their destination.  They soon find themselves disembarking at the cathedral - but not ruined.  It is surrounded by lush gardens and a wrought iron fence.  Nearby, a group of children has gathered and is commencing a game of hide and seek.  A small girl of about seven or eight runs over, smiles at the two newcomers, puts her finger to her lips, and slides through the bars of the fence.  Looking back over, they see that the "It" child has finished counting, and is moving off in the other direction.  As they turn toward the cathedral, the see a hooded figure standing over the girl well over by the church building.  "Found you," he says with an evil smirk, and then lifts the girl up and disappears into the cathedral.  They briefly hear her scream of terror before the doors close.

Gunther immediately scales the fence, but is delayed at the top by his mammoth cloak.  Dropping down in the garden, he sees about 15-20 acolytes closing in with curved daggers. They demand he surrender, which he does, although he retains his cloak.  They take him to the cathedral and bind his hands.  Dagobert, who was more hesitant upon seeing the girl being snatched, is able to hide, and then scale the fence at another location.  He begins sneaking through the gardens.

Inside the cathedral, the small girl approaches Gunther and his guards.  "Why is there just one?" she says.  "There were two coming to kill me.  Find the other one!"  Just then a great wail sounds from the garden.  "He's by the gargoyle!" says the young witch.  "I knew I liked that gargoyle.  I think I'll keep it."  Many of the guards disperse out the main door.  Switching to the modern Irontongue, she demands of Gunther, "Why did you come here? Who sent you?" Guther replies, "I thought you were the Witch of Eternity.  I thought you knew everything that has happened and will happen.  Surely you must know."  

"I know the Allfather sent you.  He is afraid of the mighty power of the Beyond, which will destroy him and subjugate his people.  It is inevitable... just as your death is inevitable.  You killed my sisters!  Do you know how long it will take me to create new sisters?"

"I thought you were the Witch of Eternity - Time shouldn't be an issue.  No, we came of our own free will.  That's why you couldn't foresee us coming.  That's why we were able to kill your sisters, and that's why you don't know what my friend is up to, or what I'm about to do."

The witch pauses.  To the guards, she says, "Prepare this one for the ritual.  Don't let him try anything.  And do the same with that other one.  I must consult my augury." She disappears into a door beyond the pulpit.

Outside in the garden, Dagobert's skulking skills are being put to the test as a pack of guards spreads out around the gargoyle where he was last spotted.  Hiding beneath the spreading, umbrella-like leaves of a line of low plants, he curses to himself as two of the guards pause, standing directly over him, and begin to carry on small talk.  Realizing that time is not on his side, he flicks a twig over to one side of the garden.  The noise attracts the two guards, and he makes a beeline for a side door... only to find it barred from the inside.  With only second before his cover is completely blown, he bangs on the door and waits, dagger in hand.

Back inside, four guards sneer at Gunther.  After some moments, Gunther quietly asks the smallest acolyte (the runt) for permission to relieve himself.  The small guard agrees, but the largest guard, a huge brute, immediately overrules.  After a few moments, Gunther, feigning weakness, whispers to the small one that he needs a drink of water.  The small guard begins to head toward a side passage when the huge guard turns to yell at him.  As he does, Gunther steps forward and knees him in the groin.  The guard drops his knife, and Gunther rolls and grabs it with his tied hands, taking off across the cathedral as he quickly slits the ropes around his wrists.  The other two guards are in hot pursuit, but Gunther whirls and deftly dispatches them with a stunning flurry of knifework.  The brute, recovering, roars in rage and grabs a massive floor-mounted iron candelstand.  Gunther throws the dagger, which buries itself in the brute, but he ignores it as he charges.  Grabbing his own candelstand, Gunther clashes mightily with the brute, throwing him off balance and then caving his head in with a single blow.

The small guard, shaking, sprints off down the side passage where he unbars a door to the outside... and has his head slammed backward against the doorframe by Dagobert.  The guard crumples so quickly that Dagobert holds his dagger blow.  "That was easy," he laughs as he steps inside, closing and barring the door.  Moving silently he reaches the main aisle of the cathedral just as two guards are running down it toward Gunther.  He hears the sound of other acolyes running up the long aisle from the main entrance.  As the two guards pass Dagobert's side passage, he whirls his shillelagh and obliterates one's knee.  The second pauses, but isn't fast enough to avoid a long dagger in his lung.

Swaggering down the aisle, swathed in his mammoth cloak, Gunther wields his iron candlestand, annihilating the pair of acolytes leading the charge from the main entrance.  Others, who are arriving from outside, hesitate at the chaos and carnage.  Some flee, while others stand at the door, frozen, backlit by the azure and red of the alien sky.  

The Ironsworn exchange a look, and then turn and dash through the door toward the Witch of Eternity.

(Note: beyond that door is the entrance down to the newly built and recently dedicated catacomb.  "Good! My first corpses!")
