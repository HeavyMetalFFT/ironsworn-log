# Summary

## Session 0

Dagobert skips town thanks to a tip from his barkeep buddy, and meets Gunther at Red Falls.  Gunther tells him of finding the dead druid, and asks (since he's not doing anything, and is an experienced hunter) if he wants to help him seek out the Ash Bear.  Just then, the militia is spotted coming up the river.  The two leave promptly, unable to gather ample supplies for their journey, and give the militia the slip in the wilds.

They journey west across the plains of the Havens and into the eastern Deep Wilds, encountering few challenges.  They find the bald-topped mountains known as the Three Sisters that rise from the forest, their sides cloaked in dense green.  

Scouting reveals that there are Ash Bears everywhere, and that they have physical enhancements such as increased speed and strength, as well as glowing red eyes.  In addition, they always patrol in pairs.  It becomes evident that they are guarding the Three Sisters, and that there is a central alarm system that can summon the bears if something (such as a stray Wyvern) is detected on any of the mountains.

After some days of scouting and observation, the pair sneak successfully into the patrolled territory, aided by magical fox pelts which mask their appearance and scent.  They discover a blast door, complete with keypad and retina scanner, leading into the side of a rock face.  A bear can occasionally be seen entering and exiting using the retina scanner.

The pair waits until a bear enters the door, and then use Dagobert's hawk "Falco" (plus a polecat pelt) to set off the alarm.  They successfully slip into the door as the Ash Bear comes running out, unnoticed despite only having a single working fox pelt between them.

Inside they find a hallway of dark, polished granite, its walls set with glowing sconses.  A utility drone skitters up the hall on some task, but pays them no mind.

## Session 1

They investigate the Three Sisters installation.  Using stealth, they avoid a passing patrol spider, but generally find the installation eerily abandoned except for the single-minded, ant-like maintenance drones.  Gunther finds a large locked door, and notices that a maintenance drone uses a pheremone to open it.  He kills an ant and pushes it against the detector, which succeeds in opening the door.

Inside they find three tiny closets with automatic doors.  Stepping into one reveals it to be a fully automated lift, which the pair mistake for a magical teleportation chamber.  

The lift deposits them in a fully subterranean chamber excavated from the top of the central mountain.  Exploration reveals mysterious chambers full of inscrutible devices, but the pair are drawn to a room with a throne atop a dais.  Dagobert, ever power-hungry, sits in the throne and dons the "crown", a helmet connected to the wall by a flexible wiring conduit.  He finds that he is able to observe the area around the installation as if flying, though with limited detail; furthermore, he is able to zoom in on each patrol bear.  Gunther is intrigued by the ability to mind-meld with bears, and after using the throne, finds that he is able to experience the sensory products of each patrol bear - and even synthesize those of multiple bears - all intuitively.  

Realizing that the throne must be the key to the bears, they explore further and discover a rear chamber behind the throne.  The chamber is filled with cylindrical vats of thick crystal, capped on each end with bright metal and containing pulsing, brain-like organs set in a viscous, transparent golden ichor.  The throne assembly itself is connected to the vats via devices which hum softly and are covered in faint, glowing lights.

The pair smashes all the brain vats except for two, which they disconnect and bundle up to take with them.  Returning to the throne room, they find that all but two of the bears have fled into the wilds.  Two bears remain in an unresponsive state.  

The two stealthily retrace their steps to the exit and seek out the nearest bear.  As they draw near with the two brain vats, the bear jerkily animates and attacks, although suffering from severe glitching and general impairment.  After a battle in which both Ironsworn suffer grave maulings but no broken bones, the bear is brought down and its carcass harvested.  

That night, a severe storm prevents Gunther from enchanting the carcass.  The two argue over what to do next, and come near to falling out.  Dagobert stubbornly wishes to return to Warm Springs and murder Niles; meanwhile Gunther wants no part in this vendetta.  Eventually Dagobert agrees that a second bear pelt would provide a potential material advantage, and the two begin a hunt for the second bear.

This task proves challenging, however, as during the night the bear has regained some consciousness and control.  The two are forced to track the bear, and encounter a band of ten elves who launch arrows on sight.  The pair flees, with Dagobert disappearing under a giant fallen tree, while Gunther outdistances the elves after several minutes' chase.  After carefully regrouping, the pair continue and make camp in a clearing deep the forest, where Gunther is able to enchant the bear pelt.  The following day they find a deep cavern into which the second bear has withdrawn.

They ambush the bear in the cavern, and another hard-fought battle ensues, in which Gunther is severely wounded.  That night evidence of a serious infection begins to emerge, and the two spend the night damaged, ill-supplied, and beset by prowling carrion creatures.  A chill wind laden with the stench of filth blows through the cavern, and an aura of doom hangs about the place.
