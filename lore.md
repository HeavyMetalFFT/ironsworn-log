## Ironlands
The Ironlands were formed when a terraformed interstellar vessel was forced to land on our planet.  It crashed into an icy northern island group, destroying many of the central islands.  The islands to the southwest became the barrier islands, while some larger masses to the north were also spared destruction.  These northern islands are often connected to the Ironlands by sea ice.  High-quality meteor metals, many of them ferrous, stud the land, their craters often weathered and overgrown.

## Old Ones
The original crew of the vessel went mad during their space journey, as did the central control AI that administers the ship/continent.  These are what we call The Broken.

The giants of the north are natives of the northern islands, and have since begun exploring south as far as the Tempest Hills.

The elves lost 90% of their population due to the aftereffects of the crash, as well as vast amounts of their significant cultural centers.  The survivors were isolated clans from the west of their empire, who have since begun to spread to the new land.  They wear their masks as a ward against the Hunters, tracking beasts employed by the central AI to further its mad ambitions.  The Hunters appear to rely heavily on facial recognition.

## Varou
An abominable cross between Broken, wolf, and reptile.  Created by the AI in order to subjugate this land and hunt down the forces that continue to evade the Hunters (elves, Broken, also newcomers to a lesser extent).

## Eldritch Forces
The arrival of this new continent has awakened ancient slumbering demon lords from the deeps seas and the icy north.  Additionally, the central AI apparently went mad during the space journey.  What sort of force caused this?  

## A Great Plague and Violent Floods
...accompanied the arrival of the new land.  People all over the more populous and hospitable realms were driven to despair by the disease, famine, war, and lawless chaos that followed.  Our coastal peoples put their trust in their shipbuilding and sailing, and struck out toward the eerie light of the northern seas.
