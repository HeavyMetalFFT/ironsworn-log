## Ironlands
The Ironlands were formed when a terraformed interstellar vessel was forced to land on our planet.  It crashed into an icy northern island group, destroying many of the central islands.  The islands to the southwest became the barrier islands, while some larger masses to the north were also spared destruction.  These northern islands are often connected to the Ironlands by sea ice.  High-quality meteor metals, many of them ferrous, stud the land, their craters often weathered and overgrown.

## Old Ones

### The Broken
The original crew of the vessel went mad during their space journey, as did the central control AI that administers the ship/continent.  These are what we call The Broken.

Over the millenia, the Broken forgot all the knowledge of their forefathers.  They reverted to medieval tech, and began worshipping the AI, whom they refer to as The Watcher (sometimes Watcher in the Sky, and other variants), or sometimes pluralized as the Watchers.  Belief across The Broken is far from standardized.  Other sects also arose, including those who worshipped the Beyond, a force they claim lives in the blackness and can only be seen with the corner of your eye.

### Giants
The giants of the north are natives of the northern islands, and have since begun exploring south as far as the Tempest Hills.

### Elves
The elves lost 90% of their population due to the aftereffects of the crash, as well as vast amounts of their significant cultural centers.  The survivors were isolated clans from the west of their empire, who have since begun to spread to the new land.  They wear their masks as a ward against the Hunters, tracking beasts employed by the central AI to further its mad ambitions.  The Hunters appear to rely heavily on facial recognition.

### Varou
An abominable cross between Broken, wolf, and reptile.  Created by the AI in order to subjugate this land and hunt down the forces that continue to evade the Hunters (elves, Broken, also newcomers to a lesser extent).

The Varou are led by shamans who use a ritual to communicate with the AI, whom they call Allfather. The Allfather is said to have a single eye that can see all things.  The Varou shamans also employ ravens and other fell beasts as minions.

## Eldritch Forces
The arrival of this new continent has awakened ancient slumbering demon lords from the deeps seas and the icy north.  Additionally, the central AI apparently went mad during the space journey.  What sort of force caused this?  

## A Great Plague and Violent Floods
...accompanied the arrival of the new land.  People all over the more populous and hospitable realms were driven to despair by the disease, famine, war, and lawless chaos that followed.  Our coastal peoples put their trust in their shipbuilding and sailing, and struck out toward the eerie light of the northern seas.

* The Marcher Lord's Chamberlain, Niles, had a long-standing grudge against Dagobert, and took this opportunity to have him dismissed from the household.
* Got into a number of fights in town
* Niles left the employ of the Marcher Lord and rose to become a member of the Town Council in Warm Spring

### The story of Niles versus Dagobert:

Niles was in charge of the Marcher Lord's household - all the servants, the grounds, and the upkeep for the guards (though he was not their commander).  His general mode of operation was to spy on everyone.  He used his position to advance his personal wealth, extort favors of all kinds, and keep others in fear of punishment.

Dagobert was one of the few people in the household who was seemingly immune to Niles' influence.  This was because he acted as 'problem solver' and occasional frankly-honest confidante for the Marcher Lord.  Niles always suspected Dagobert of plotting, which in fact was quite untrue - it was Niles and the Marcher Lord who were always plotting. Dagobert is not witty enough to plot, usually.

While preparing for the voyage to the Ironlands, Niles arranged for Dagobert to be put in charge of a ship in their fleet.  During the voyage, the fleet was separated, and Dagobert's ship arrived a month late, having been briefly forced to shelter on an uninhabited island.  Upon Dagobert's arrival, Niles revealed that many of the valuables that had been recorded as being on his ship were missing.  The Marcher Lord, though doubtful, found himself destitute (several other ships had gone missing entirely).  He eventually allowed Niles to accuse Dagobert, at which Dagobert left town.

The Marcher Lord left to become a farmer.  Niles had bigger plans, and stayed in Warm Spring, quickly acquiring a seat on the town's ruling council.

Our story began upon Dagobert's return to Warm Spring after he got into an altercation with someone who brings up the accusations of his past, and again leaves for Red Falls (with Niles and the militia on his trail).
