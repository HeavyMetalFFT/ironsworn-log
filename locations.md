# Locations

## Warm Spring
Built over top of an alien reactor that vents heat into the waters around it.  The top of the ancient reactor forms a plateau outside of town.  Mysterious alien runes mark the outside bringing bold red and yellow coloring the the weathered matte grey monolith.

## Red Falls Outpost
A trading outpost.  Set next to a waterfall that often catches the sunset in a blaze of glory.  Downstream lies Warm Spring, 4 hours.  Upstream and beyond is wilderness.

## Three Sisters radio sensor installation
The Three Sisters house what was at one point a deep-space EM sensor array, as well as the associated local control, maintainence, and power installation.  The central AI has decided to repurpose the array into an active directed energy array for use in its onging campaign against the Demon Lords.  To this end, it is buffing up the power station and supply lines, replacing the delicate receive sensors with high-power capable transmitters, and tweaking control systems as needed.
