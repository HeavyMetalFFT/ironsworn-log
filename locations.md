# Locations

## Warm Spring
Built over top of an alien reactor that vents heat into the waters around it.  The top of the ancient reactor forms a plateau outside of town.  Mysterious alien runes mark the outside bringing bold red and yellow coloring the the weathered matte grey monolith.

## Red Falls Outpost
A trading outpost.  Set next to a waterfall that often catches the sunset in a blaze of glory.  Downstream lies Warm Spring, 4 hours.  Upstream and beyond is wilderness.

## Three Sisters radio sensor installation
The Three Sisters house what was at one point a deep-space EM sensor array, as well as the associated local control, maintainence, and power installation.  The central AI has decided to repurpose the array into an active directed energy array for use in its onging campaign against the Demon Lords.  To this end, it is buffing up the power station and supply lines, replacing the delicate receive sensors with high-power capable transmitters, and tweaking control systems as needed.

## Broken Fort on the Withered Plain
The first settlement of Broken ever encountered by men.  Wooden palisade and fort with earthen motte.  Surrounded by a handful of communal farms.  A tribe of a few hundred Broken live here, ruled by their chieftain, Xaal.  The Ironsworn helped divert a raid by Varou away from the settlement and into a successful ambush.  The tribe here tell that several decades ago they were forced to flee their home city (which they call Yaat Zhp Uraas meaning City Beneath the Lake) and travel south, finally settling here.  See Lore from Session 2.  

## The Broken city beneath the crater lake
Much is still to be learned for sure.  The huge tree that sits above the entrance to the city is a bioengineered solar array that provided energy for the city.  It could potentially have served other purposes as well.

## Dark Forest amidst the Tempest Hills
Haunted by 3 witches.  Home of the Elder Druid, Old Man Oak, keeper of the Staff of Heimdall.  In the middle is the enchanted lake where lies the Great Tree of the Sun and the entrance to the Fallen City Beneath the Lake.
